  <h1>That Man Robert Mitchum... Sings</h1>
  <p> This song is important to me... was played at my wedding. To this day I'm not sure how he could be such a good singer as well as being a good actor... astounding! He had two albums, I own both. The first is a Calypso album, coinciding with his turn into the "Romantic Comedy"... the second ten years later was That Man Robert Mitchum... Sings. The song is question is off this album...
