    <h1>About:</h1>
    <p>
    Looking for a man who can do it all... SAY NO MORE! My Robert Mitchum fansite takes a look into the actor, the man behind many of Hollywood's most famous roles. In real life, Mitchum was self-effacing and direct, as demonstrated by his famous quote on acting. "This is not a tough job. You read a script. If you like the part and the money is O.K., you do it." <br>
    <br>
    Here, you can find clips and facts for his entire career, including his scandalous arrest for smoking "reefer". Robert Mitchum has been my favorite actor for as long as I remember..... ever since his days with RKO studio pictures. My favorite of his is the movie "Out of the Past" (1947) with a former investigator running into some trouble involving some shady business and some dangerous women...
